          Create a new product tag (version=1)


          - **product**: which product

          - **k**: which key for the tag

          - **v**: which value to set for the tag

          - **version**: none or empty or 1

          - **owner**: none or empty for public tags, or your own user_id


          Be aware it's not possible to create the same tag twice. Though, you
          can update

          a tag and add multiple values the way you want (don't forget to
          document how); comma

          separated list is a good option.
