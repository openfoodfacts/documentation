          Authentication: provide username/password
          and get a bearer token in return.

          - **username**: Open Food Facts user_id (not email)
          - **password**: user password (clear text, but HTTPS encrypted)

          A **token** is returned. If the **set_cookie** parameter is set to 1,
          the token is also set as a cookie named "session" in the response.

          To authenticate, you can either:
          - use the **Authorization** header with the **Bearer** scheme,
          e.g.: "Authorization: bearer token"
          - use the **session** cookie, e.g.: "Cookie: session=token"
