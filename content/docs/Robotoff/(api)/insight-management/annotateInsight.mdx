          The annotation can be submitted as an anonymous user or as a
          registered user.

          If the user is anonymous, the annotation will be accounted as a vote,
          and several identical

          anonymous votes are required to apply the insight. If the vote is sent
          from a registered user,

          it is applied directly.


          To send the annotation as a registered user, send Open Food Facts
          credentials to the API using

          Basic Authentication: add a `Authorization: basic {ENCODED_BASE64}`
          header where `{ENCODED_BASE64}`

          is an base64-encoded string of `user:password`. Don't provide an
          authentication header for anonymous

          users.


          The annotation is an integer that can take 4 values: `0`, `1`, `2`,
          `-1`. `0` means the insight is incorrect

          (so it won't be applied), `1` means it is correct (so it will be
          applied) and `-1` means the insight

          won't be returned to the user (_skip_). `2` is used when user submit
          some data to the annotate endpoint 

          (for example in some cases of category annotation or ingredients
          spellcheck).


          We use the voting mecanism system to remember which insight to skip
          for a user (authenticated or not).
