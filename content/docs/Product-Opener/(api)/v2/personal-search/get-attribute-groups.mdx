          Attributes are at the heart of personal search.

          They score the products according to different criterias,

          which could then be matched to a user's preferences.


          This API helps you list attributes and display them in your
          application,

          for the user to choose the importance of each criteria.


          note: `/api/v2/attribute_groups_{lc}` is also a valid route, but
          consider it deprecated
