          This API allows to create or update a product (if the product already
          exists, its data is updated, otherwise it is created), or to analyze a
          test product (in which case no product is created or updated). To
          analyze a product, the "barcode" path component needs to contain the
          value "test" instead of a barcode.


          New API to send structured product data in a JSON format instead of in
          a flattened list of key / value pairs field as-in the current product
          add / edit API that relies on a multipart/form-data format.


          Important: this new Product WRITE API has been deployed in production,
          but it is still under development, and it may change.


          This new API is used in particular to send structured packaging data:
          https://openfoodfacts.github.io/openfoodfacts-server/dev/explain-packaging-data/


          The new API is gradually being extended to support other product
          fields.


          Currently supported fields are:
            - language specific fields (e.g. product name, ingredients text)
            - tags fields (e.g. categories, labels)
            - packaging fields (e.g. packagings, packagings_add, packagings_complete)
            - image selection of uploaded images (e.g. front, ingredients, nutrition, packaging) for specific languages
