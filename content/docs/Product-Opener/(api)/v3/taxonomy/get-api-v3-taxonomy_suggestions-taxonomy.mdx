          Open Food Facts uses multilingual
          [taxonomies](https://wiki.openfoodfacts.org/Global_taxonomies) to
          normalize entries for categories, labels, ingredients, packaging
          shapes / materials / recycling instructions and many more fields.


          This API returns taxonomy entries suggestions that can be used in
          product edit forms, search forms etc. (for instance in autocomplete
          dropdowns using libraries like Tagify or select2 on the Web).


          Suggestions filtering:


          The string parameter allows to get only suggestions that contain a
          specific string (useful for autocomplete suggestions).


          Suggestions ordering:


          - For packaging shapes and materials, suggestions are ordered first by
          the number of packaging components they appear in (restricted by
          country, categories and shape (for materials) if they are passed as
          parameters).

          - for all other taxonomies, results are ordered alphabetically


          If a string is passed, an additional sort is done to put first
          suggestions that start with the string, followed by suggestions with a
          word that start with the string, and then suggestions that contain the
          string anywhere.
