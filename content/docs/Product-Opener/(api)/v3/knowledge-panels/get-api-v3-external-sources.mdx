_openapi:

          Returns the ordered list of external knowledge panel sources
          configured on the server.


          Providers can use the `knowledge_panel_url` field to point to their
          own API.

          The URL may contain **template variables** that the frontend will
          expand before calling:


          - `$code` → product barcode

          - `$lc`   → UI language (2 letters)

          - `$cc`   → user/device country (2 letters)


          Example:

          `https://provider.example.com/off/v1/knowledge-panel/$code?lang=$lc&country=$cc`


          The frontend percent-encodes the variable values when substituting
          them into the URL.
