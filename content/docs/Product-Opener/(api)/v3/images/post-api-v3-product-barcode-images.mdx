          This endpoint allows to upload an image for a product. The image is
          uploaded in the request body as a base64 encoded string.

          Optionally, it is possible to select the uploaded image for specific
          information (e.g. front, ingredients, nutrition, packaging) for
          specific languages. Each selected image is a cropped version of the
          uploaded image.


          If the product does not exist, it will be created.
